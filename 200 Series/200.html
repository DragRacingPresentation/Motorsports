The Top fuel centrifugal clutch has fingers on it which, under rotation, will provide pressure on the clutch pack. As more fingers press down at higher rotational speeds, the clutch pack compresses further, locking up the clutch and allowing for the full engine torque to be supplied to the wheels. The difference between a good run and a bad run in the NHRA all comes down to how well you execute clutch slip and provide the absolute maximum torque to the driven wheels without them fully breaking loose. The drivetrains are usually AWD and RWD. The Funny Car Engines have no more than 1 camshaft and 2 valves per cylinder which are supercharged and have fuel injection the engines are 500 cubic inches and can cost around $50k. They can be around 10k to 11k horsepower and they only last around 1-5 runs. The engines are loosely based on the 426 hemi and it runs on a fuel mixture of 85-95% nitromethane and 10-15% methanol.
