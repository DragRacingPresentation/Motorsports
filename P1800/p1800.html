	<p class = "border" >The rules and regulations require each driver to have seat belts, working headlights and tail lights a secured battery, and DOT-Approved tires. When racing you must be wearing long pants (no nylon), a sleeved shirt, closed-toe shoes, and socks. The driver must have A driver's license and valid vehicle registration and insurance. The car must have a muffler on the exhaust system. Nitrous is optional but if you use nitrous it must be stamped saying it meets the DOT 1800 lb standards.</p>
